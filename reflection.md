# What I Learned

Developing this Personal Finance Tracking Application reinforced several key concepts in Python and software development. 

Firstly, applying **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles allowed for a clean and extensible code structure. Creating a base `Transaction` class and subclassing it for `Income`, `Expense`, and `Investment` made it easy to manage different transaction types while sharing common attributes like date and amount. This structure also simplifies future extensions, such as adding new transaction types.

Secondly, I learned how to effectively use **Streamlit** to build interactive web applications quickly. The ease of creating forms, metrics, and visualizations (like bar charts) with just a few lines of code demonstrated the power of Streamlit for data-driven apps. I also gained experience in handling **state and data persistence** using CSV files, ensuring that user data is not lost between sessions.

Finally, implementing the **analytics and string analysis** features provided a practical use case for Python's string manipulation methods and collection types (like sets and dictionaries). Overall, this project highlighted the importance of separating core logic from the user interface, making the code more testable and maintainable.
